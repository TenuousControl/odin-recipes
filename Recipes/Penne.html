        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An easy Italian pasta with spicy, Spanish chorizo with greens and cream cheese.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>400g penne</li>
            <li>small head of broccoli, broken into small florets</li>
            <li>200g cooking chorizo, diced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fennel seed</li>
            <li>200g low-fat cream cheese with garlic & herbs</li>
            <li>parmesan and rocket leaves, to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the penne following pack instructions, adding the broccoli for the final 3 mins. When cooked, drain, reserving a splash of the cooking water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fry the chorizo in a large dry frying pan until it starts to turn golden and release its oils. Add the garlic and fennel seeds, and cook for 1 min more. When the penne is cooked, tip it into the pan with the chorizo. Add the cream cheese, stir together until melted, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water so the sauce coats the pasta.</li>
            <li>Serve in bowls, scattered with a few rocket leaves and some grated Parmesan, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
